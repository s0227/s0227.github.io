	<article><img src="6.jpg" style="height: 10cm; width: 5cm; float: right;">My name is Sarah Leong. I am a F4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section). I

have been a member of the school handbell team for 4 years. This year, I am studying in the business

stream. I like playing guzheng and piano. I have be practicing piano for less than 4 years and guzheng

for 6 years. Iâ€™m also interested in economics and English. I have a plan about studying guzheng in

Beijing in the future. I would like to open a music tutorial company after that.
